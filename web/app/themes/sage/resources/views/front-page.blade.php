    <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl">ðŸ‘‹ Hello friend.</h3>
    <p>My name is Nathan. I am a web designer and developer living in Calgary.
    Brrrr â›„ is right! Iâ€™m originally from Vancouver so Iâ€™m not super used to
    the cold. I never went to school for programming, but I had the rare
    privilege of being born into a <em>very</em> technology friendly family
    &mdash; so I grew up hacking computers from a young age.</p> <p>I intend to
    make this website a blog, a portfolio, and a place to share a part of me to
    the web. For now you can follow <a href="https://twitter.com/kn_wler">@@kn_wler on Twitter</a> for a random and sporadic stream of my thoughts. Checkout <a href="https://github.com/knowler">@@knowler on GitHub</a> to see what Iâ€™m currently hacking. And finally, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/knojo">listen to me try to play guitar</a> on SoundCloud. If you need to get ahold of me, you can do so by <a href="mailto:nathan@knowler.me">emailing nathan@knowler.me</a>. I would love to connect with you!</p>

    <h2>My Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Your website should serve you &mdash; not the other way around.</li>
      <li>Your website should be fast. I use the best practises to ensure your website is high performance through and through.</li>
      <li>Your website should look good. Nobody wants a website that looks bad.</li>
      <li>Your website should work on mobile. Itâ€™s {{ date('Y') }}! Most people will be viewing it on mobile anyway.</li>
      <li>Your website should work for everybody. This means it needs to be accessible.</li>
      <li>Your website should be findable. My best practises combined with your awesome content will bring you to the top of the search results.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Products &amp; Services I Provide</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Websites that work.</li>
      <li>Internal tools &ndash; your workflow is important to your business.</li>

  <div class="rich-text max-w-lg w-full">
    <h2>Technologies I Use</h2>
    <p>I strive to use relevant and modern technologies. This is my current toolset:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>WordPress</strong> &ndash; I know what youâ€™re thinking? WordPress? It does power a massive portion of the web. But how much of that is just Internet garbage? Forget everything you know about your last WordPress site. I use <a href="https://roots.io">modern tools</a> to build WordPress sites that donâ€™t suck.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Laravel</strong> &ndash; If your website needs extended functionality that a CMS does not provide, I can build it with Laravel instead.</li>
      <li><strong>React</strong> &ndash; </li>
    </ul>
