  "html": "<p>2023 was a great year for CSS. Notably, we has <code>:has()</code> and we got\nnesting across browsers now! And there’s so much more.</p>\n<p>In 2024, I’d love to see the following implemented in all browsers:</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-style-queries-for-custom-properties\">1. Style queries for custom properties</h2>\n<p>These are going to revolutionize how we write component styles. One\nsignificant use-case is allowing you to create your own custom-CSS-API\nfor a component—I’ll write more on this in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-text-box-trim-and-margin-trim\">2. <code>text-box-trim</code> and <code>margin-trim</code></h2>\n<p>These aren’t the same, but I’ve grouped them together because they are\njust so useful for typography. I recently created a printed document and\nI used Safari Technology Preview just so I could use both of these. They\nseem like low hanging fruit for implementation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-the-scope-rule\">3. The <code>@scope</code> rule</h2>\n<p>So much of the styles we write are candidate for the CSS <code>@scope</code> rule. <a href=\"https://12daysofweb.dev/2023/css-scope/\">Miriam Suzanne has a fantastic article</a> about this. Also, scope proximity is fascinating!</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-scroll-driven-animations\">4. Scroll-driven animations</h2>\n<p>I work on websites that use scroll animations all over the place. Being\nable to do these all with CSS would be awesome and there are so many\nother use cases for them beyond just your typical scrolly-telling sites.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-types-for-attr\">5. Types for <code>attr()</code></h2>\n<p>Using attribute values for properties other than <code>content</code> would be\ngreat. This goes hand-in-hand with style queries and will greatly\nimprove how we write component styles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-anchor-positioning\">6. Anchor positioning</h2>\n<p>While I haven’t been following this too closely, the fact that there is\nwork being done here is fantastic and makes me excited for its\nimplementation across browsers. I’m elated to see all that we can now\nachieve without JS that is also accessible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-view-transitions\">7. View transitions</h2>\n<p>View transitions are magical and I really do hope we see more progress\nhere towards stable implementation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thank-you-css-wish-fulfillers\">Thank you CSS wish fulfillers</h2>\n<p>I want to end this by expressing gratitude for everyone involved in the\nprocess of making these CSS wishes come true. Whether you are working on\nspecifications, research, implementation, experimenting, or offering\nfeedback—I am so grateful for you and your work. You make the web a\nbetter place. Thank you!</p>",
