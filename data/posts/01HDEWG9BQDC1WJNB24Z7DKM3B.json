It’s by no means a replacement for <code>zsh</code>, but taking a writing-first approach for my work rather than writing as infrequent side effect of my work has been very beneficial for me mentally.</p>\n<p>I’m someone who usually has a tonne on their mind whether I am in front of a computer or not. Context-switching is very difficult. Written prompts are an incredible aid, but when they aren’t front and centre I’m hopeless.</p>\n<p>I think that by starting my work from a notebook, I can be more focused and directed with my work while creating written artifacts which will help me avoid repeating work every time I change contexts.</p>\n<p>I’ll see how it goes.</p>\n",
