The class names aren’t there so much to tell you what things are—that’s a nice benefit—but since they are technically necessary to tame the cascade. When the technical need for those class names is removed (i.e. using <code>@scope</code>) is the apparent need for templating still as strong?</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, I think templating is great, I’m just wondering if we overplay its need when some of the underlying problems are being solved by other means.</p>"
