The major reason this took so long is because I am stubborn and I didn’t want to use an off-the-shelf solution. Another reason is because I overthink a lot, in fact as I write this, all I’m thinking about is what is currently wrong with my implementation.</p>\n<p>Something outside of my control was that for a long time Deno Deploy didn’t have a first-party way to persist data or asynchronously handle tasks. This was solved when they released their <a href=\"https://deno.com/kv\">KV</a> database and more recently when they introduced their <a href=\"https://docs.deno.com/kv/manual/queue_overview\">Queues</a> which builds on KV.</p>\n<p>Some priorities post-launch:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the UI of the form.</li>\n<li>Improve the error messaging of the REST API.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some ideas for the future:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Differentiate the types of webmentions (e.g. reposts, likes, my own syndicated posts).</li>\n<li>Send webmentions when I post new content.</li>\n<li>Allow webmentions for non-posts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n<p>I’d like to acknowledge the Begin/Enhance crew’s <a href=\"https://github.com/enhance-dev/enhance-blog-template\">Enhance Blog Template</a> which I definitely used as inspiration for my own implementation of webmentions (I may have even copied some code). They’re doing some great stuff with <a href=\"https://enhance.dev\">Enhance</a>. <small>I’d probably be using it if I was less stubborn and I didn’t like Pug so much.</small></p>",
