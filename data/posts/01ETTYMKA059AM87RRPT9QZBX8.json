I believe in someways this year music\nwas a lot more meaningful to me this year and the albums I treasured the most\nseem to reflect that, though they might be surprising.</p>\n<h2 id=\"favourite-albums-of-the-year\">Favourite albums of the year</h2>\n<p>I’ll keep my comments to a minimum, but here are my favourite albums I listened\nit to this year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-brain-pain-by-four-year-strong\">1. <em>Brain Pain</em> by Four Year Strong</h3>\n<p>I love the energy of this album and I feel like I can just put it on anytime.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-people-with-dreams-by-john-mark-mcmillan\">2. <em>People with Dreams</em> by John Mark McMillan</h3>\n<p>This album will always remind me of our home in Calgary. It was the home my\ndaughter was a newborn in and despite the lonliness of lockdown, the summer was\nbright and she brought sweetness to life as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-a-beautiful-place-to-drown-by-silverstein\">3. <em>A Beautiful Place To Drown</em> by Silverstein</h3>\n<h3 id=\"4-afterburner-by-dance-gavin-dance\">4. <em>Afterburner</em> by Dance Gavin Dance</h3>\n<p>I’d say this was my most anticipated album of the year and to be honest it\ndidn’t quite live up to my expectation for it, but I still loved it and listened\nto it a ton nonetheless.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-the-new-abnormal-by-the-strokes\">5. <em>The New Abnormal</em> by The Strokes</h3>\n<p>I listened to this album a ton when we were all just adjusting to life in the\npandemic. We went to stay with my parents for a month and the early summer\nweather combined with Okanagan backdrop made it a very enjoyable listen. I\nremember going for a few drives where my daughter and I listened to this until\nshe fell asleep.</p>\n<h2 id=\"favourite-non-2020-albums-of-the-year\">Favourite non-2020 albums of the year</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><em>A Different Shade of Blue</em> by Knocked Loose (2019)</li>\n<li><em>Science Fiction</em> by Brand New (2017)</li>\n<li><em>Die On Mars</em> by The Callous Daoboys (2019)</li>\n</ol>\n"
