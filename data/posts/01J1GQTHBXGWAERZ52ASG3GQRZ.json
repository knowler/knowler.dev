  "html": "<p>This week <a href=\"https://sunny.garden/@knowler/112684253934419619\">I suggested the idea of a “Web Standards Book Club” on\nMastodon</a> and there was a bit of interest. After thinking about how\nsuch a club would work, I’ve decided that since I suggested the idea of\nthe club to the fediverse, the club will take place in the fediverse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-participate\">How to participate</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Follow the hashtag <code>#ReadThePlatform</code> in the fediverse. Feel free to\nlurk or to secondhand read.</li>\n<li>Read books or content about the Web Platform at your own pace. Sync\nup with others if you’d like.</li>\n<li>Share about that content using the hashtag. Feel free to share\nanything you write about it on your website too.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There’s no formal meet up times, but don’t let that stop you from\norganizing meetups to discuss with others.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-own-reading-list\">My own reading list</h2>\n<p>I’m no authority here — you can read whatever you’d like, but here is my\nown initial, tentative reading plan if you’d like to follow along with\nme:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://htmlparser.info\"><em>Idiosyncrasies of the HTML parser</em></a> by <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@zcorpan\">Simon Pieters</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://browser.engineering\"><em>Web Browser Engineering</em></a> by <a href=\"https://pavpanchekha.com\">Pavel Panchekha</a> &#x26; <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@chrishtr\">Chris Harrelson</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wpc.guide\"><em>Web Platform Contribution Guide</em></a> by various authors</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All of these books are free to read online, open source, and in the case\nof the first two, you can support the writers as they continue to write\ntheir respective books. Those details can be found in the links above.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-im-doing-this\">Why I’m doing this?</h2>\n<p>My own personal motivation for reading books and other content about the\nWeb Platform is not only to deepen my understanding of the medium as it\naffects my work, but so that I can contribute in more ways. I’ve been\ninspired by individuals involved in moving the Web forward and I believe\nthat the Web is ours and not just the product of large companies. I\nbelieve in the Web and so I am reading to ensure the Web continues to\nhave a future, because <a href=\"https://knowler.dev/blog/the-web-is-not-inevitable\">the Web is not inevitable</a>.</p>"
