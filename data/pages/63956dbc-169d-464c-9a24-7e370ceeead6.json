  "html": "<p>I am a workflow junkie, so I’m always refining what I use. This page is an outline of the hardware and software that I use on a daily basis with varying degrees of details about those choices.</p>\n<h2 id=\"devices-and-operating-systems\">Devices and Operating Systems</h2>\n<p>I’ve used MacBook Pros as my daily driver for the last decade. I like macOS. I can make it feel like Linux, but still benefit from the OS exclusive apps it has, which is especially important for my work as a web developer.</p>\n<p>My current phone is an iPhone 13 Pro. Boring, I know.</p>\n<h2 id=\"peripherals\">Peripherals</h2>\n<p>Generally, I just use my MacBook’s keyboard and trackpad. I do have an <a href=\"https://ergodox-ez.com/\">ErgoDox EZ</a> that I use when I use a second monitor or if I am using my desktop computer. It’s tough to get used to since often I just need to get work done. I know I just need to take a few weeks of dedicated use to force myself to get better at it. I suspect it will be like learning anything with a steep learning curve (e.g. vim, tmux, etc.).</p>\n<p>I have an old 24-inch BenQ monitor that I use. It’s not a high DPI screen which both isn’t great for regular use, but also is good for testing some designs. One day I’ll upgrade it.</p>\n<p>For audio, I use a first generation Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 as an audio interface. I run that into a set of PreSonus Eris E4.5 studio monitors. I get the most use out of my first generation Sennheiser Momentums. I’ve replaced its cable about four times and the muffs at least once. I love them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"software\">Software</h2>\n<p>Most of the configuration for the software that I use is store in my <a href=\"https://github.com/knowler/dotfiles\">dotfiles</a> repository. I wrote a piece about <a href=\"https://knowlerkno.ws/garden/maintaining-dotfiles\">how I go about maintaining these dotfiles</a>.</p>\n<p>On macOS, I use <a href=\"https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai\">yabai</a> as a tiling window manager along with a <a href=\"https://www.hammerspoon.org/\">Hammerspoon</a> configuration called <a href=\"https://github.com/AdamWagner/stackline\">Stackline</a> and a <a href=\"https://github.com/cmacrae/spacebar\">spacebar</a> as my status bar. On Manjaro, I use <a href=\"https://swaywm.org/\">Sway</a>.</p>\n<p>I’ve replaced Spotlight with <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/\">Alfred</a> on macOS. I have a number of workflows that I use with this.</p>\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty\">Alacritty</a> as my terminal emulator. It’s written in Rust, so it’s fast. I wish it had support for ligatures, but I still prefer it over Kitty.</p>\n<p>Along with Alacritty, I use <a href=\"https://github.com/tmux/tmux\">tmux</a> as my terminal multiplexer. I have the two integrated really nicely with some nice keyboard shortcuts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.zsh.org/\">zsh</a> is my shell of choice. I do tend to write all my scripts in Bash though. I use <a href=\"https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto\">Prezto</a> as my base configuration, but do have it stripped back a fair bit. On top of that I use <a href=\"https://starship.rs/\">Starship</a> as my prompt.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://neovim.io/\">Neovim</a> is my general purpose text editor. I love it. Check out my <a href=\"https://github.com/knowler/dotfiles\">dotfiles</a> to see what plugins I have installed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"surfin-the-web\">Surfin’ the Web</h3>\n<p>For browsing, I use <a href=\"https://arc.net/\">Arc</a> and I love it.</p>\n<p>I really like <a href=\"https://hypothes.is/\">Hypothesis</a> for annotating web pages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reading-writing-and-listening\">Reading, Writing, and Listening</h3>\n<p>I use Apple Books on mobile and desktop. For podcasts I use <a href=\"https://www.pocketcasts.com/\">Pocket Casts</a>. I also use it for audiobooks when I have the actual files.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://netnewswire.com\">NetNewsWire</a> is my RSS reader. I use it with <a href=\"https://github.com/xwmx/nb\">nb</a> for bookmarking. I use nb for notetaking as well. I really like it so far since it uses Git under the hood and lets me use my editor for writing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aesthetics\">Aesthetics</h2>\n<p>I’ve used <a href=\"https://github.com/dominiklohmann/25th-hour\">“25th Hour”</a> as a dynamic wallpaper on macOS for the last couple of years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cocopon.github.io/iceberg.vim/\">Iceberg</a> as my colour scheme for pretty much everything. <a href=\"https://gumroad.com/l/dank-mono\">Dank Mono</a> is the font I use for code.</p>"
