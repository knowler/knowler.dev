I grew up in Metro Vancouver, but I’ve lived on the Canadian Prairies for the past decade.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-am-a-web-developer\">I am a web developer</h2>\n<p>I currently work as a Senior Frontend Developer. I built my first website in 2006 and since then the Web has been my jam. I’ve worked full stack for most of my career, however, the frontend is my preference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-am-passionate-about-accessibility\">I am passionate about accessibility</h2>\n<p>Moving to Saskatchewan in 2013 made me realize that my experience of the Web in the well-connected tech hub of Vancouver was not the norm for everyone everywhere. It was then that I began the journey of learning how others experience the Web and how I could positively or negatively impact those experiences in my work as a web developer.</p>"
