# Welcome

I am Nathan Knowler. I’m originally from Vancouver, however, I now live
in Winnipeg and work remotely as a web developer for <a href="https://impress.org" rel="noreferrer">Impress.org</a>.

This is my own place on the web. I am currently in the midst of an open
redesign. Here’s a sort of sitemap you can you to navigate around the
site for now:

- [Accessibility Statement](/accessibility/)
- [Digital Garden](/garden/)
- [Curriculum Vitae](/cv/)
- [Uses](/uses/)
