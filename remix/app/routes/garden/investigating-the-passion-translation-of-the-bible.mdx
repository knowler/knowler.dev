# Investigating _the Passion Translation_ of the Bible

Over the last few years, I’ve heard a fair bit of buzz about _the Passion Translation_ of the Bible. There have been varying opinions about _TPT_. I have friends who love it and I have other friends who speak of it as if it should be burned. I happen to own a copy of the New Testament (which includes the Psalms, Proverbs, and Song of Songs) and the Book of Isaiah. I figure I ought to investigate it myself. I’ll present my findings here. For now this is mostly point form and there are some questions I have throughout (some could seem obvious — I’m just being meticulous).

* _The Passion Translation_ is a new English translation of the Bible.
  * Is it a translation or a paraphrase? The title seems to indicate the former.
* “The purpose of the Passion Translation is to reintroduce the passion and fire of the Bible to the English reader. It doesn’t merely convey the literal meaning of words. It expresses God’s passion for people and his world by translating the original, life-changing message of God’s Word for modern readers.”
  * What does this mean by _passion_?
  * What does this mean by _fire_?
  * "the original, life-changing message of God’s Word" seems to indicate that this is being translated from the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament.
* Its “lead translator” is Dr. Brian Simmons.
  * Who is Dr. Brian Simmons? Where and what is his doctorate in?
  * _Lead_ seems to imply that there is a sort of translation team. Is this so? And if true, who else is involved?

Mike Winger’s "Passion Project" videos were very helpful. I particularly found the interviews he did with a number of respected biblical scholars to provide a well executed critique to the translation. The consensus seemed to be that it functions more like a paraphrase than a translation (Douglas Moo doesn’t like the dichotomy in general, which I found interesting and agreeable) and it is not all bad, however, there is enough bad to be concerned (_bad_ is not adequately descriptive language, I will update this on further revisions). The primacy given to the Aramaic seems to be one major flaw. That whole hypothesis just doesn’t make sense, especially given the audience of a large number of New Testament letters. One of the other concerns is how the thing is being marketed. Watching videos of how the whole _TPT_ has been presented, especially to lay audiences who don’t know any better, is so astonishing that I’m inclined to call it spiritual abuse. At the end of the day it seems like _TPT_ is a mediocre translation (or paraphrase if that’s the category it fits in for you) which seems to be a result of a number of quite foundational flaws in its translation philosophy.
