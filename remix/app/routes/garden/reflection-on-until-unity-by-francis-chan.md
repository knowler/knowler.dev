# Reflection on _Until Unity_ by Francis Chan

I think a practical step towards church unity is staying where you are. Thereâ€™s a draw for many, especially young people, to start something new, but we need to trust the God of the resurrection and commit ourselves to the old thing that we might think is dying or maybe smells bad to us. This is especially the case for myself. I know that my theology differs greatly than most churches that I might find myself in. I am called to be united with them though. Starting or seeking my own thing will only work against unity.
