# {attributes.meta.title}

I’ve begun investing some time into a good researching workflow for myself. I’ll
document some of my findings here.

Right now I have an interesting combination of using the following:

- Eleventy as a static site generator. Helpful for reading and viewing research.
- Zettelkasten
- Git Annex

For the most part a research folder can stay flat and then I take notes in
Markdown files. From those files I can link to any resource that I am working
with which I can store with Git Annex.
