Over the last few years, I’ve heard a fair bit of buzz about _the Passion Translation_ of the Bible. There have been varying opinions about _TPT_. I have friends who love it and I have other friends who speak of it as if it should be burned. I figure I ought to investigate it myself. I’ll present my findings here. For now this is mostly point form and there are some questions I have throughout (some could seem obvious — I’m just being meticulous).

* _The Passion Translation_ is a new English translation of the Bible.
  * Is it a translation or a paraphrase? The title seems to indicate the former.
* “The purpose of the Passion Translation is to reintroduce the passion and fire of the Bible to the English reader. It doesn’t merely convey the literal meaning of words. It expresses God’s passion for people and his world by translating the original, life-changing message of God’s Word for modern readers.”
  * What does this mean by _passion_?
  * What does this mean by _fire_?
  * "the original, life-changing message of God’s Word" seems to indicate that this is being translated from the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament.
* Its “lead translator” is Dr. Brian Simmons.
  * Who is Dr. Brian Simmons? Where and what is his doctorate in?
  * _Lead_ seems to imply that there is a sort of translation team. Is this so? And if true, who else is involved?
