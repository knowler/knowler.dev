# {{title}}

Recently found out that I was wrong about something that I’ve taught others. My gut reaction was to double down on learning “the right thing.” That’s good and all, but I realized that my motivation was just to be right. That’s a bad goal that I will always fail to attain to. Being right and not wrong is not good posture for a teacher. Good posture is recognizing that I am limited in my knowledge. I have blindspots. I will change my mind about some things. I will need to be corrected. Humility seems absolutely vital for teaching in any capacity. But so does boldness. I can’t let my lack keep me from sharing what I have with others. Bravery and humility go hand in hand.
