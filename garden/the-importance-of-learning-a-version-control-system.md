# {{title}}

Learning how a filesystem works is arguable the most important thing to learn for using an operating system. I’m sure there are other concepts which we take for granted (e.g. I/O), but I think learning how the filesystem works is relevant for any computer user. In fact, I would go as far as saying that it sets apart those who know how to use a computer and those who do not. I’m sure that features like search are attempting to reduce the importance of this and to improve ease of access.

Now this isn’t about the _most_ important thing for using computers. This is a next thing towards mastery. This is about version control...
