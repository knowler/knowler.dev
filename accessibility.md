# Accessibility Statement

I want this website to be as accessible as possible. I am
building this website with this goal in mind. This page will be
used to document how I intend on meeting this goal, how I am
testing the accessibility of this website, and if there are any
known accessibility issues.

## Features

This site uses <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr> attributes when necessary to improve the experience.

## Testing

Currently, I am testing with macOS’ VoiceOver screen reader. In
the future I’d like to test on Windows as well.

## Issues

I’ve done my best with ensuring sufficient WCAG 2.1 AA contrast
so far. I’m worried that the content link contrast might not be
enough. As well, I haven’t been able to give the focus styles as
much attention as they deserve, so they are the browser defaults
for now.

## Feedback

If you find any other issues that I haven’t accounted for,
please help me address them by [submitting an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/knowler/knowlerkno.ws/issues/new).
