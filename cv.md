# Curriculum Vitae

This is a work in progress and should by no means seen as complete.

_I am a web developer focused creating beautiful, accessible user
interfaces._

## Skills

_Computerz_. The web is the primary medium I work with, however, I also have a
depth of knowledge working with computers in general.

- Web accessibility
- Design systems
- API design
- Progressive enhancement
- Git
  - I’ve been called a “Git mystic.”
  - I’m usually the person called in to help clean up messes.

## Work

### Liquid Web

I have worked as a web developer at Impress.org since October 2019. When GiveWP
was acquired by Liquid Web May 2021, I joined with the rest of the team.

* I was on a small team that created an MVP for a new product. It was primarily
  built with Laravel and React. Much of my work was focused on the product’s
  design system.
* For GiveWP, I refactored the new form fields API that is beginning to be
  adopted throughout the ecosystem.

### Freelance

I freelanced largely from 2013 until my current position.

### True Market

From January to December 2018, I worked for True Market, a full-serve
marketing agency in Calgary. I was a full stack developer and the
primary developer on the team.

* I was responsible for researching and implementing a new web stack.
* As the development team grew, I created developer tools for
  scaffolding projects.
* I developed WordPress plugins to address common needs across client
  sites.
 
### Accent Guitar Studio

I started this job in high school (maybe 2010). I was the webmaster of the
website at the time and I also built websites for different bands the studio
managed. Along with the web development work, I helped as a sound technician and
as a music transcriptionist. I left this job in 2013 when I left to Saskatchewan
for college.

## Education

In April 2021, I earned a Bachelor of Biblical Studies from Eston
College.
