### Liquid Web

I have worked as a web developer at Impress.org since October 2019. When GiveWP
was acquired by Liquid Web May 2021, I joined with the rest of the team.

* I was on a small team that created an MVP for a new product. It was primarily
  built with Laravel and React. Much of my work was focused on the product’s
  design system.
* For GiveWP, I refactored the new form fields API that is beginning to be
  adopted throughout the ecosystem.

### Freelance

I freelanced largely from 2013 until my current position. I handled a variety of
projects: simple landing pages and marketing websites, product demos, MVPs, and
full stack applications, consulting, and technical writing.

_TODO: explain more._

### True Market

From January to December 2018, I worked for True Market, a full-serve marketing
agency in Calgary. I was a full stack developer and the primary developer on the
team.

* I was responsible for researching and implementing a new web stack.
* As the development team grew, I created developer tools for scaffolding
  projects.
* I developed WordPress plugins to address common needs across client sites.
 
### Accent Guitar Studio

I started this job in high school (maybe 2010). I was the webmaster of the
website at the time and I also built websites for different bands the studio
managed. Along with the web development work, I helped as a sound technician and
as a music transcriptionist. I left this job in 2013 when I left to Saskatchewan
for college.

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>

In April 2021, I earned a Bachelor of Biblical Studies from Eston College.
