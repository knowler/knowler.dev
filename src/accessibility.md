# Accessibility Statement

I want this website to be as accessible as possible. I am
building this website with this goal in mind. This page will be
used to document how I intend on meeting this goal, how I am
testing the accessibility of this website, and if there are any
known accessibility issues.

## Features

This site uses <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr> attributes when necessary to improve the experience.

## Testing

Currently, I am testing with macOS’ VoiceOver screen reader. In
the future I’d like to test on Windows as well.

As a build step, I am using the Netlify <abbr title="accessibility">A11y</abbr> build plugin.

## Issues

Currently, I haven’t implemented any custom colours, so the
contrast is at its maximum. As I craft the colour palette for this
site, I will do my best to fix this.

If you find any other issues that I haven’t accounted for,
please help me address them by [submitting an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/knowler/knowlerkno.ws/issues/new).
