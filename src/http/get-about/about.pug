	+h-entry("About Nathan Knowler")
		p.
			My name is Nathan Knowler. I live in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada —
			Treaty 1 territory — with my family. I grew up in Metro Vancouver,
			but I’ve lived on the Canadian Prairies for the past decade.
		+h2("I am a web developer")
		p.
			I currently work as a Senior Frontend Developer with
			#[a(href="https://wearekettle.com" rel="noreferrer") Kettle]. I
			built my first website in 2006 and since then the Web has been my
			jam. I’ve worked full stack for most of my career, however, the
			frontend is my preference.
		+h2("I am passionate about accessibility")
		p.
			Moving to Saskatchewan in 2013 made me realize that my experience
			of the Web in the well-connected tech hub of Vancouver was not the
			norm for everyone everywhere. It was then that I began the journey
			of learning how others experience the Web and how I could
			positively or negatively impact those experiences in my work as a
			web developer.
