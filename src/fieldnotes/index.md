# Fieldnotes

This is the home to my notes on my field of study, the web. I have a particular
interest in user experience. These notes are shared in various degrees of polish
and veracy (never intentionally inaccurate though), so take them with a grain of
salt.

Currently, I am thinking about:

- Modals
- Focus management (as it pertains to the web)
