# Uses

I am a workflow junkie, so I’m always refining what I use. This is a list of the hardware and software that I use on a daily basis with varying degrees of details about those choices.

## Devices and Operating Systems

I’ve used MacBook Pros as my daily driver for the last decade. I like macOS. I can make it feel like Linux, but still benefit from the OS exclusive apps it has, which is especially important for my work as a web developer.

I do have a desktop PC that I built when I was a teenager. It serves as a backup work computer and a gaming rig. Currently, I have [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org) and Windows 10 installed on it.

My current phone is a Xiaomi Mi A2 Lite. I’ve had it for about three and half years. I just keep stock Android on there. I used to muck around with custom ROMs and what not.

## Peripherals

Generally, I just use my MacBook’s keyboard and trackpad. I do have an [ErgoDox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/) that I use when I use a second monitor or if I am using my desktop computer. It’s tough to get used to since often I just need to get work done. I know I just need to take a few weeks of dedicated use to force myself to get better at it. I suspect it will be like learning anything with a steep learning curve (e.g. `vim`, `tmux`, etc.).

I have an old 24-inch BenQ monitor that I use. It’s not a high DPI screen which both isn’t great for regular use, but also is good for testing some designs. One day I’ll upgrade it.

For audio, I use a first generation Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 as an audio interface. I run that into a set of PreSonus Eris E4.5 studio monitors. I get the most use out of my first generation Sennheiser Momentums. I’ve replaced its cable about four times and the muffs at least once. I love them.

## Software

Most of the configuration for the software that I use is store in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/knowler/dotfiles) repository. I wrote a piece about [how I go about maintaining these dotfiles](https://knowlerkno.ws/garden/maintaining-dotfiles).

On macOS, I use [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) as a tiling window manager along with a [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) configuration called [Stackline](https://github.com/AdamWagner/stackline) and a [spacebar](https://github.com/cmacrae/spacebar) as my status bar. On Manjaro, I use [Sway](https://swaywm.org/).

I’ve replaced Spotlight with [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) on macOS. I have a number of workflows that I use with this.

I use [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) as my terminal emulator. It’s written in Rust, so it’s fast. I wish it had support for ligatures, but I still prefer it over Kitty.

Along with Alacritty, I use [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) as my terminal multiplexer. I have the two integrated really nicely with some nice keyboard shortcuts.

[zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) is my shell of choice. I do tend to write all my scripts in Bash though. I use [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) as my base configuration, but do have it stripped back a fair bit. On top of that I use [Starship](https://starship.rs/) as my prompt.

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is my general purpose text editor. I love it. Check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/knowler/dotfiles) to see what plugins I have installed.

### Surfin’ the Web

For browsing, I use Firefox for personal and Brave for work. I really wish that Firefox’s container tabs and Chromium’s group tabs could have a baby or something. And no — Chromium profiles are not the same as container tabs.

I really like [Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is/) for annotating web pages.

### Reading, Writing, and Listening

I use [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) for ebooks on the Desktop and [ReadEra Premium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.readera.premium) on mobile. For podcasts I use [Pocket Casts](https://www.pocketcasts.com/). I also use it for audiobooks when I have the actual files.

[Newsboat](https://newsboat.org) is my RSS reader. I use it with [nb](https://github.com/xwmx/nb) for bookmarking. I use nb for notetaking as well. I really like it so far since it uses Git under the hood and lets me use my editor for writing.

Markdown is my preferred text format, but for more formal work, I use LaTeX.

## Aesthetics

I’ve used [“25th Hour”](https://github.com/dominiklohmann/25th-hour) as a dynamic wallpaper on macOS for the last couple of years.

[Iceberg](https://cocopon.github.io/iceberg.vim/) as my colour scheme for pretty much everything. [Dank Mono](https://gumroad.com/l/dank-mono) is the font I use for code.
