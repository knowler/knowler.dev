title: Discourse and tongues
---

The interpretion and speaking of tongues in todayâ€™s world seems like it would
better manifest itself not as being able to interpret and speak different
languages or as a prayer language, but as being able to hear what people are
actually saying and to speak to people in language that they actually
understand. People might be speaking in the same language, but no one
understands what the other is saying. Discourse is dead and only the Spirit of
God can revive it.
