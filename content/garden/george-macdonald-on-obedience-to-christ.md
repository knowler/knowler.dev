I was reading Alan Jacobs’ “Snakes and Ladders” blog and I stumbled upon this
quote from George MacDonald:

> Instead of asking yourself whether you believe or not, ask yourself whether
> you have this day done one thing because He said, Do it, or once abstained
> because He said, Do not do it. It is simply absurd to say you believe, or even
> want to believe, in Him, if you do not do anything He tells you.
