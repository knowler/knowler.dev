title: Belief, Salvation, and “Evangelism” in the Christian faith
description: ''

---
For a longtime, I’ve felt a discontentment with how I’ve observed the practice of “evangelism” in the Christian circles that I am a part of. I _think_ that the expression of the practice is not just limited to my circles and _may_ be what is practised at large in at least North America.

Before, I outline what said discontentment is, I do want to make it abundantly clear that I do believe that the death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ, is good news that _must_ be shared. I am not here to dispute that. I do not condemn, but rather commend those whose heart it is to share that good news.

Where I take issue is in perhaps what we believe the task to be and, dare I say, what success in that task looks like. No, I am not proposing that somehow our salvation hinges on success in the task — we are saved by grace through faith in Christ Jesus. Salvation is a costly gift which has been freely given to us.
