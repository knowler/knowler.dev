# Digital Garden

This is my digital garden. These are works, of mostly writing, that are in
various stages of production and may or may not always bear my intention of
publishing on my blog or elsewhere. They could be simple notes to self,
explorations of a topic, experiments in a field, anecdotes, etc. Feel free to
wander and engage if you are inclined. I love to be sharpened by others. Just
promise to keep in mind that the contents of these could need a little water, so
to speak, and there will certainly be some posts that I’ve neglected, and in
some cases are beyond recovery. I may need some prompting to uproot some
weeds.
