In Genesis 1:11, from the New Living Translation, it says:

> Then God said, “Let the land sprout with vegetation—every sort of
> ==seed-bearing== plant, and trees that grow ==seed-bearing fruit==. These
> seeds will then produce the kinds of plants and trees from which they came.”
> And that is what happened.

I was listening to this on the Streetlights audio Bible, read by Propaganda, and
it made me wonder, what does it mean to be _someone_ who produces _seed-bearing_
fruit. Is this what Jesus or the Apostles or the Hebrew Scriptures has in mind
when they talk about _fruit_?
