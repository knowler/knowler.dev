# On Notetaking

This is sort of like a journal of my journey to take better notes.

## Tuesday, Febrary 9, 2021

I am taking a class right now. It’s actually the last class in my Biblical
studies degree. Never thought I’d get here. I digress.

I’ve been fairly disappointed in my notetaking abilities. I have been for a long
time, but it’s really starting to surface in me this week. It seems like I tend
to either copy the slides directly or not take notes at all. It makes no sense
that I copy the slides directly since I *have* the file for the slides. When I
remember that, then I just don’t take any notes. It’s frustrating — I’m either
one extreme or the other.

I think I need to learn how to do this better.

Tomorrow, I’ll try this idea of atomic notes. I think that if I create a note
for an idea that I find interesting and keep the scope to just that note, it
might mean that my notes are clearer and therefore more useful. We’ll see how it
goes.
