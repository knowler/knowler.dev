I love rounding up my favourite albums at the end of the year
and that time has finally come for 2018. Iâ€™ll also take a look
into what Iâ€™m anticipating in 2019.

## Favourite albums of the year

There seemed to be a lot of metalcore releases this year. Of
course thatâ€™s not all I listen to, but will definitely reflect
in my list. Iâ€™m going with a weird number â€”Â 4 albums â€”Â for my
best of 2018 list. Here we go:

### 4. [Untitled] by mewithoutYou

This album surprised me a lot. First of all, it came out of
nowhere; it was released very quickly. Second of all, the EP
they released before it made me think it would have a similar
sound â€”Â kinda soft and folky â€” but no, right from the first
track â€” 9:27 7/29 a.m. â€” this album rips. This album also
includes a lot of really cool post-rock-y ambient sequences
(notably on "Michael, Row Your Boat Ashore"). Overall, Iâ€™m super
impressed with this dynamic addition to mewithoutYouâ€™s wonderful
discography.

**Favourite track:** ["Wendy & Betsy"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Em3PlrwjE)

### 3. Holy Hell by Architects

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to be able to do justice with words how
meaningful this record is. Holy Hell is packed with emotion.
Architects has been known for this type of emotion, but this
album was a whole new level in light of the passing of founding
guitarist Tom Searle in 2016. Now the band has taken the time to
process their grief and the resulting album is amazing tribute
to Tom. Iâ€™ve lost count how many time Iâ€™ve listened to this
cover to cover. Rest in peace Tom.

**Favourite track:** ["Royal Beggars"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNpWuwSVyDk)

### 2. Empty Black by Greyhaven

I had never heard of this band until I see a tweet from Garett
in Silent Planet saying to check them out. They did not
disappoint, in fact, I listened to this album _a ton_. Greyhaven
does a great job of blending a lot of sounds and as a
consequence have a very unique sound and voice in their music.
This band is for lovers of Every Time I Die, The Dillinger,
Escape Plan, Norma Jean, or The Chariot â€” anything that rips.

**Favourite track:** ["Broadcast Network"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUGi7NDNWds)

### 1. Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It by Rolo Tomassi

I only started listening to Rolo Tomassi with their last album,
Grievences, and they for sure filled the jazzy, shoegaze,
mathcore craving I never knew I had.

When this album was released I went for a drive and listened to
it in its entirely â€” twice â€” it was that good. The band ebbs and
flows in and out of spacey ambience throughout the entire album.
This record contains some of their heaviest sequences yet. Eva
Spence is the most dynamic vocalist in prog music â€” *seriously*.
She seamless transitions from the deep growls to the light, airy
vocals. I would definitely recommend checking out this record
and the rest of Rolo Tomassiâ€™s discography.

**Favourite track(s):**
["Balancing the Dark"](https://rolotomassi.bandcamp.com/track/balancing-the-dark)
and
["Alma Mater"](https://rolotomassi.bandcamp.com/track/alma-mater)
(together) â€”Â amazing.

## A look to the future: 2019

The almighty **Norma Jean** is recording a new album right now.
Theyâ€™re my mainstay, so Iâ€™m pumped for new jams from them. I
probably spin their entire discography at least twice a month.
Will **Oh, Sleeper** finally release a new album? I hope so and
their latest single is a good sign. Finally, I really hope to
see a new album from **As Cities Burn**. I have no expectation
for what it to sound like â€”Â I love all of their previous albums
despite how different they all are.

Personally, a goal Iâ€™m making for myself in 2019 is to write
more in-depth reviews of new music throughout the year.
Hopefully, by this time next year, I can share a much fuller
year in review for music.

Anyways, that's my list and my hopes for 2019. See you in the
new year. ðŸŽ‰
