I listened to a lot of music this year. I believe in someways this year music
was a lot more meaningful to me this year and the albums I treasured the most
seem to reflect that, though they might be surprising.

## Favourite albums of the year

I’ll keep my comments to a minimum, but here are my favourite albums I listened
it to this year.

### 1. _Brain Pain_ by Four Year Strong  

I love the energy of this album and I feel like I can just put it on anytime.

### 2. _People with Dreams_ by John Mark McMillan  

This album will always remind me of our home in Calgary. It was the home my
daughter was a newborn in and despite the lonliness of lockdown, the summer was
bright and she brought sweetness to life as well.

### 3. _A Beautiful Place To Drown_ by Silverstein

### 4. _Afterburner_ by Dance Gavin Dance

I’d say this was my most anticipated album of the year and to be honest it
didn’t quite live up to my expectation for it, but I still loved it and listened
to it a ton nonetheless.

### 5. _The New Abnormal_ by The Strokes  

I listened to this album a ton when we were all just adjusting to life in the
pandemic. We went to stay with my parents for a month and the early summer
weather combined with Okanagan backdrop made it a very enjoyable listen. I
remember going for a few drives where my daughter and I listened to this until
she fell asleep.
