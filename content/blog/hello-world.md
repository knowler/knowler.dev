What is this? This is a place for me to turn my thoughts into
words. This post will give a brief introduction to me and how I
intend to use this blog.

## Who am I?

My name is **Nathan Knowler**. I am a human being living in
western Canada who codes to feed himself and his family.

## How will I use this blog?

I donâ€™t want to pigeon-hole the content too much, but what I
think readers can expect is my thoughts on code, music, and
perhaps topics relating to real life.
