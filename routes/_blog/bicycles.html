<p>At the beginning of this summer, my wife and I bought bicycles. Since
moving to Manitoba, I had wanted a bike as living outside of the city
	and being a one-car-family had often left me limited to where I could
reasonably walk. The closest bus stop was 45 minutes away. When we moved
into the city this all changed.</p>
