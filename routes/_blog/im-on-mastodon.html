<p>While I’ve only recently <a href="https://twitter.com/kn_wler/status/1556097942196568065">rejoined Twitter</a>, I’ll most likely be spending more time on Mastodon. <a href="https://sunny.garden/@knowler">@knowler@sunny.garden</a> is where you can find me.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I’ll be blogging more hopefully. Been investing a lot more in my website lately. I set up Webmentions so I can receive those now — though I will be processing them manually. One day I’m make it automated. I’d like to start micro-blogging on here as well. So much to do. One thing at a time though, haha.</p>
