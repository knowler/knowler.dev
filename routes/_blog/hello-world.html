<p>What is this? This is a place for me to turn my thoughts into words. This post will give a brief introduction to me and how I intend to use this blog.</p>
<h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2>
<p>My name is <strong>Nathan Knowler</strong>. I am a human being living in western Canada who codes to feed himself and his family.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t want to pigeon-hole the content too much, but what I think readers can expect is my thoughts on code, music, and perhaps topics relating to real life.</p>
