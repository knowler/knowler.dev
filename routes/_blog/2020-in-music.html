<p>I listened to a lot of music this year. I believe in someways this year music
was a lot more meaningful to me this year and the albums I treasured the most
seem to reflect that, though they might be surprising.</p>

<p>I’ll keep my comments to a minimum, but here are my favourite albums I listened
it to this year.</p>
<h3 id="1-brain-pain-by-four-year-strong">1. <em>Brain Pain</em> by Four Year Strong</h3>
<p>I love the energy of this album and I feel like I can just put it on anytime.</p>
<h3 id="2-people-with-dreams-by-john-mark-mcmillan">2. <em>People with Dreams</em> by John Mark McMillan</h3>
<p>This album will always remind me of our home in Calgary. It was the home my
daughter was a newborn in and despite the lonliness of lockdown, the summer was
bright and she brought sweetness to life as well.</p>
<h3 id="3-a-beautiful-place-to-drown-by-silverstein">3. <em>A Beautiful Place To Drown</em> by Silverstein</h3>
<h3 id="4-afterburner-by-dance-gavin-dance">4. <em>Afterburner</em> by Dance Gavin Dance</h3>
<p>I’d say this was my most anticipated album of the year and to be honest it
didn’t quite live up to my expectation for it, but I still loved it and listened
to it a ton nonetheless.</p>
<h3 id="5-the-new-abnormal-by-the-strokes">5. <em>The New Abnormal</em> by The Strokes</h3>
<p>I listened to this album a ton when we were all just adjusting to life in the
pandemic. We went to stay with my parents for a month and the early summer
weather combined with Okanagan backdrop made it a very enjoyable listen. I
remember going for a few drives where my daughter and I listened to this until
she fell asleep.</p>
