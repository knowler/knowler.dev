<p>I want this website to be as accessible as possible. I am building this website
with this goal in mind. This page will be used to document how I intend on
meeting this goal, how I am testing the accessibility of this website, and if
there are any known accessibility issues.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>This site uses <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr>
attributes when necessary to improve the experience.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>Currently, I am testing with macOS’ VoiceOver screen reader. In the future I’d
like to test on Windows as well.</p>
<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<p>I’ve done my best with ensuring sufficient WCAG 2.1 AA contrast so far.</p>
<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>
<p>If you find any other issues that I haven’t accounted for, please help me
